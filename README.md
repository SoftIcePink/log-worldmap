# log-worldmap
d3.js worldmap with plot markers based on locations given by an API (the ip of the locations come from a log file)

I forgot to write a readme apparently. 

This rep is deprecated, could be done better.
In any case, to use it, you either need a key (see the files in index.html note)
or you can use the test file.
